the unix_style is for scripts that are using unix eol semantics, namely
0x'0a' (newlines only), and the 'windows_style' is for windows eol semantics,
name '0d0a'.  Turns out on windows machines, the scripts all have windows semantics
in spite of the fact that the browser works fine with both semantics.  I'm primarily
testing with unix_style semantics, which means that if you put a file under 'unix_style'
make sure you run 'dos2unix' against first, if seeding under windows.
